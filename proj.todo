streamline UI so that it goes:
	launch -> camera -> use photo button -> (superimposed ocr progress indicator) -> event entry

X since this is really just a camera thing that then shows an event thing, just do everything but the event part in one view controller

------------------------

So the streamlining part is working, except that there's no event entry component

It currenlty never finds anything because apparently the image is null until we render it somehow
